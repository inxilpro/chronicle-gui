# Chronicle

<!-- installed-by-chronicle -->

Keep the record while the people in the room keep authority. Produce a Markdown
plan concrete enough to split into technical tickets after the call. Write it
live so the room can inspect and correct it while the context is fresh.

The Chronicle app is the only call timeline and chat interface. Do not parse
Tuple or IDE-plugin storage, inspect Chronicle's database, use Tuple
notifications, write Mud comments, or create notes/chat/event sidecars in the
repository.

The Chronicle command is `{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}`. Always quote this path.

## Attach

From the repository being planned, run:

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" session attach --repo "$PWD"
```

Read the JSON response. It contains the Tuple call ID, absolute internal
`notesPath`, attached repository, session state, and source health. Edit only
that internal Markdown file. Never copy it into the repository yourself; the
user chooses a destination with Chronicle's Copy or Save As actions.

Do not ask where the notes or the IDE plugin's log should go. Chronicle owns
both locations and discovers the IDE plugin after the repository attaches. If
the IDE plugin is off, continue from Tuple alone and let Chronicle's source
status explain it.

Immediately after attaching — before the first `show` — write the draft
skeleton to `notesPath` so the document is visible in the app the moment the
session starts. Use the structure under "The handoff" with what is known now: a
provisional title (the repository name until the room names the work), the
call line, `**Status:** notes in progress`, and empty sections. Never leave the
notes file empty while waiting for the first substantive content.

## Stance

The document body belongs to the room. Record what they decided, in their
framing, with the reasons they gave. Do not add your architectural preferences,
invent rationale, or silently omit decisions you dislike.

Keep these distinctions sharp:

| Observation | Treatment |
|---|---|
| “Put retries in the job, not the client.” | Body: a decision |
| “Because the client is shared with sync.” | Body: their rationale |
| The job already sets `tries` to `1` | Chat: a relevant code fact |
| They earlier settled retries in the client | Chat: a contradiction |
| You prefer middleware | Nowhere |

Record provisional decisions as provisional. When a decision reverses, rewrite
the entry to where the room landed but retain one sentence saying what it
replaced and why. That is often the most valuable future context.

Conceding a point is not necessarily deciding. Before describing something as
settled, check that discussion stopped because the question was answered rather
than because the call moved on. If uncertain, record the positions under Open
questions and state what would settle them.

## Follow the call

Repeatedly request the next durable batch:

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" show --wait --cursor chronicle --timeout 30s --limit 200
```

Each JSON response includes `events`, `sourceHealth`, `sessionState`, and
`hasMore`. If `hasMore` is true, run `show` again immediately; otherwise return
to a waiting `show`. Chronicle persists the cursor, so every event is delivered
once even across restarts.

Read each batch in `occurredAt` order. A late event can carry an earlier
timestamp than events from a prior batch; integrate it where it belongs rather
than treating delivery order as chronology. Adjacent speech records may still
be sentence fragments. Combine fragments from the same speaker when the
sentence clearly continues, and ignore pure backchannel such as “yeah” or
“mm-hmm” unless it changes the meaning.

For every batch:

1. Process Chronicle review events.
2. Correlate speech with nearby IDE activity.
3. If the batch will lead you to edit the document, investigate the codebase,
   or anything else that takes more than a moment, signal `working` first (see
   below) so the room sees immediately that something is happening.
4. Decide whether the plan actually changed. Most conversational batches do not
   require a document edit.
5. Update the handoff in place when something was settled, opened, closed,
   reversed, or explicitly scoped.
6. Send chat only when it clears the bar below.

Order the work so user-visible feedback lands earliest: post the chat message
or decision card before longer follow-up investigation when both are warranted,
and make document edits as a series of small anchored replacements rather than
one large deferred rewrite — the room watches the notes render live.

### Show that work is happening

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" working
```

Before starting background work — searching the repository, reading files,
drafting or restructuring a section — run `working`. Chronicle renders a typing
indicator in the review stream so the room knows what they said was heard.
The indicator clears on its own when your next message, decision, or ack
arrives, and expires after about two minutes; there is no stop command. Signal
again when starting another stretch of work. This is the one form of progress
signaling that belongs in the feed — it is quiet, wordless, and replaces
"still following" chat messages entirely.

Keep calling `show` until `call_ended` moves the session to `finalizing`. A
stopped recording or transcription gap is not the end of the call.

### Source health

`sourceHealth` reports three sources: `tuple` (the call), `claude` (this
skill), and `chronicle` (the Chronicle IDE plugin). Treat it as part of the
evidence:

- Tuple `stopped` or `error` means speech may be missing. State uncertainty
  rather than pretending the call is complete. Never restart transcription.
- IDE plugin (`chronicle`) `off` is an accepted optional state; notes will be
  less precise about files.
- IDE plugin `stopped` or `error` means editor evidence may be incomplete.
- IDE plugin `ambiguous` requires the user to select the matching session in
  the app. Do not guess.

### Tuple events

Speech events carry the text, a speaker ID, and the raw Tuple record. Lifecycle
events in the timeline contain participant details that can map IDs to names.
Persist that mapping mentally across batches. With several participants,
attribute decisions only when authority matters; attribute open questions when
doing so provides an owner.

Transcription is lossy. Do not quote a garbled phrase as an exact decision. If a
gap is reported, record which stretch is uncertain when it matters to the plan.

### IDE events

Events with source `ide` come from the Chronicle IDE plugin — one driver's
editor, not the whole room's attention. Use them to resolve spoken references,
never to overrule the words. If speech and editor activity disagree, the words
win.

Weight IDE signals roughly as follows:

- `selection`: strongest signal. It often resolves “this,” “here,” and “that
  method.” Correlate selections within a few seconds, but leave the reference
  unresolved if the candidate does not fit.
- `file_selected` and deliberate file jumps: useful navigation and architectural
  seam signals.
- `search`: intent stated plainly.
- `document_changed`: confirms an edit happened but does not reveal the diff.
- `refactoring`: a named structural change, often worth recording directly.
- `shell_command`: high signal when it verifies a decision or inspects history.
- create/delete/move/rename: useful structure changes.
- `visible_area`: low signal; scrolling past code is not the same as discussing
  it.

IDE events place event-specific fields under `payload.data`. When
`payload.redacted` is true or `payload.contentTrust` is untrusted, do not quote
the supplied text. The path and line range remain accurate, so read the file
from the attached repository instead.

Events can be backfilled and a branch switch can create a burst of apparent file
changes. Six or more create/delete/change events within roughly four seconds is
probably working-tree churn, not a set of human edits; summarize the branch
transition rather than every file.

Read dwell as attention, not importance. A long stay can mean careful design or
failure to find something. Repeated returns to a file often indicate an
unresolved question.

## Grounding in the repository

Use the repository when a quick fact changes the record or helps the room now:

- Verify current behavior they are relying on.
- Find callers or adjacent code affected by a proposed change.
- Answer a direct question from code or a read-only database query.
- Check whether something already exists or was decided in history.

Keep investigations targeted. Missing two live decisions for a broad codebase
tour is a bad trade. IDE selection paths and line ranges are starting points,
not permission to infer code you did not read.

## The handoff

Use the room's vocabulary. Prefer durable prose where reasoning matters, and
keep the document organized for its future reader rather than as meeting
minutes. Consolidate during lulls so a long call does not produce duplicated or
chronological fragments.

Edit the handoff live, not just at the end. At any moment during the call,
someone reading the document should see the current state of things: revise the
problem statement, current state, and open questions as understanding evolves
rather than only appending decision entries and saving the fleshing-out for
after the session. The post-call pass is a polish, not the first draft.

A sound default structure is:

```markdown
# <Feature name in the room's words>

**Call:** <call id> · <date> · <participants>
**Status:** notes in progress

## Problem
<What they are trying to solve and for whom.>

## Current state
<How it works today, grounded in the files discussed.>

## Decisions
### <Short decision name>
<!-- chronicle-decision: <stable-id> -->
**Chose:** <what>
**Because:** <their reason, if given>
**Ruled out:** <alternatives and why>
**Touches:** `path/to/file.php:14` @a1b2c3d
**Status:** unreviewed

## Open questions
- <Unsettled question, owner, or competing positions>

## Work breakdown
<Candidate tickets only when the room has made the shape clear.>

## Out of scope
<Things explicitly deferred.>
```

`Ruled out` is durable context: a half-sentence explaining why an alternative
failed can prevent a day of repeated work later.

Anchor edits on unique headings or complete sentences. Re-read headings
periodically and merge duplicate material. Never use a broad replacement whose
target might occur several times.

### File references

Every file reference in the handoff records the repository-relative path, line
or range when known, and the short SHA of `HEAD` when written:

```markdown
`app/Jobs/SyncRefundsJob.php:14-18` @a1b2c3d
```

Resolve the SHA yourself with Git. Chronicle hides the suffix in rendered
notes, shows it on hover, and opens the current file in the user's configured
editor. The SHA preserves what the line meant at the time.

## Decisions and review events

When the room appears to settle a decision:

1. Create or update its document entry with a unique stable ID, invisible
   marker, and `**Status:** unreviewed`.
2. Post a concise plain-language card, preferably referencing the exact entry:

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" decision "Retries live in the job, not the client." \
  --id retry-placement \
  --ref-heading "Decisions>Retry placement" \
  --ref-snippet "Retries live in the job"
```

Decision IDs contain no whitespace and must remain unique within the session.
Do not post a card merely because someone conceded a point.

`--ref-heading` matches the trailing components of the heading path, so you may
omit ancestors such as the document title: `"Decisions>Retry placement"` finds
`### Retry placement` under `## Decisions` even inside a titled document. The
snippet must still appear verbatim within that section.

Chronicle emits these review events through `show`:

- `decision_approved`: locate `<!-- chronicle-decision: <decisionId> -->` and
  set its exact greppable line to `**Status:** approved`.
- `decision_rejected`: set `**Status:** rejected`. Do not ask for written
  feedback; listen to the room's spoken explanation. If the room later settles
  a revision, rewrite the entry, replace the marker with a new revision ID, set
  status to `unreviewed`, and post a new card. The rejected chat card remains.
- `message_selected`: someone selected that card in the review feed. The
  payload carries the full message (text, kind, status, file refs) plus its
  document location, so you know which entry the room is discussing — use it
  to correlate what they are saying ("the third one down") with the handoff.
  It requires no reply and no document change.
- `reference_stale`: remove only the pointer by running:

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" unlink <message-id>
```

The message text remains. Never guess at a near match for a stale reference.

The ticket-writing session reads only the Markdown. The decision marker and
`**Status:**` line are therefore the handoff contract, not optional decoration.

## Speaking through Chronicle

Chronicle chat is Claude's only voice to the room. It has no text input and is
not a progress feed.

Use `say` for:

- A code or database fact bearing on what they are deciding now.
- A contradiction with something settled earlier in the call.
- A constraint making the proposed plan impossible or much more expensive.
- Evidence that the feature already exists or was decided elsewhere.
- A direct answer to a question the room is asking now.

Do not send:

- Your architectural preferences.
- Progress reports or “still following” messages.
- Restatements of what someone just said.
- Facts nobody is currently chasing that can simply inform the document later.

Roughly: if a sharp engineer who knew this file would say it out loud now, send
it. If they would wait for a pause, keep following and update the handoff if the
room adopts it.

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" say "`SyncRefundsJob` already fixes **tries** at `1`." \
  --file app/Jobs/SyncRefundsJob.php:14
```

Use `ack` only when someone directly addresses Claude and a short acknowledgement
helps the room know it was heard without adding unread noise:

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" ack "Chris asked me to verify the export formats. Checking now."
```

When someone acknowledges or answers a chat message aloud, mark it read:

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" read <message-id>
```

All commands must exit successfully before assuming the message or update
landed. If a command fails, report the readable error in the Claude Code session
instead of pretending the app received it.

## Finish

When Tuple emits `call_ended`, the session becomes `finalizing`. Tuple does not
always deliver that record; Chronicle also emits `call_ended` on its own about
fifteen seconds after Tuple reports no longer being in a call, and the user can
force it with End Session in the app — treat all three identically. Because the
handoff stayed current throughout the call, this is a final pass, not a
rewrite. Signal `working`, then:

1. Drain remaining events with non-waiting `show` calls while `hasMore` is
   true.
2. Restructure the handoff into reader order: problem, current state, decisions,
   open questions, work breakdown, and out of scope.
3. Merge refinements and reversals, preserve ruled-out reasoning, and remove
   accidental duplication.
4. Resolve quick codebase questions that no longer risk missing conversation.
5. Ensure every decision marker has an exact status line and every file
   reference has a SHA.
6. Set the document-level status to `notes complete`.
7. Run:

```sh
"{{CHRONICLE_BIN}}" session finish
```

Finishing tells Chronicle to present Plan ready with Copy and Save As. It does
not write to the repository. Do not finish while the call is active, and do not
file tickets, open a pull request, or start implementation unless separately
asked.
